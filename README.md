## Overview

Osteosarcoma, a prevalent and aggressive bone cancer, poses significant challenges in surgical treatment due to its complex texture and intensity variations. Accurate determination of surgical safety margins is crucial to ensure complete tumor resection while preserving healthy tissue.

This study introduces an unsupervised approach leveraging open-source MRI and X-ray data, digital image processing techniques, and k-means clustering to define tumor boundaries. The methodology aims to estimate confidence intervals for surgical safety margins, facilitating automated, patient-specific surgical planning.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Uses MRI and X-ray images from the open-source repository [https://radiopaedia.org/](https://radiopaedia.org/).
- **Image Processing**: Applies digital techniques to preprocess and enhance medical images.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implements k-means clustering to delineate tumor boundaries without labeled data.
- **Margin Estimation**: Calculates confidence intervals for surgical safety margins based on clustered regions.
- **Patient-Specific Analysis**: Provides individualized assessments to support surgical decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - opencv-python

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   $git clone https://github.com/EdwinTSalcedo/OsteosarcomaUCB.git osteosarcoma
   cd osteosarcoma

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    $pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:

    - Place MRI and X-ray images in the data/ directory.

2. Run the User Interface:

```bash
$python gui.py 
```

You will obtain a inteface similar to this one:
